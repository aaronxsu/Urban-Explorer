# Urban Explorer

The first iteration of this app is done, and now it has following features:

* Register your own account
* View your journey exploration history
* View one of your previous journeys
* Choose an interesting area to explore
* Select your desirable start and end point for a trip
* Pick places of your interests from the up-to-date places DB
* Decide which route to follow to complete a trip of all recommended stops considering the time and distance cost + the street tree coverage

Now some bugs are being fixed. The App will be deployed soon.
